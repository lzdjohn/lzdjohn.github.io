Hi, I am Zhendong. This is the homepage of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. 

Biography
======
I am a rising third-year master's student in Electronic Information at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, advised by Professor Le Zhang. My research focuses on wireless sensing and human-centric action recognition. I had developed a model for long-term recorded signal in MS.C. Additionally, I am actively exploring advancements in wireless based localization. My future goal is to create a multi-modality model for temporal action detection and localization using ambient sensors that can be deployed on humanâ€“computer interaction devices.
