Hi, I am Zhendong. This homepage introduces myself and my previous research projects. 

Biography
======
I am a rising third-year master's student in Electronic Information Engineering at the University of Electronic Sci. and Tech. of China, advised by Professor Le Zhang. My research focuses on ubiquitous computing, wireless sensing and human action analysis. I had developed a model for untrimmed, long-term signal's temporal action detection. Additionally, I am actively exploring advancements in indoor localization. 

Research Projects
======
Temporal Action Detection in WiFi CSI & IMU

Future Work
======

The application of Temporal Action Detection (TAD) is currently limited. I am interested in combining TAD with other practical researches to create a multi-modal model for ambient intelligence that can be integrated into humanâ€“computer interaction devices.
