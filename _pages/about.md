Hi, I am Zhendong. This is the homepage simply introduces myself and my previous research projects. 

Biography
======
I am a rising third-year master's student in Electronic Information at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, advised by Professor Le Zhang. My research focuses on wireless sensing and human-centric action recognition. I had developed a model for long-term recorded signal in MS.C. Additionally, I am actively exploring advancements in wireless based localization. My future goal is to create a multi-modality model for temporal action detection and localization using ambient sensors that can be deployed on human–computer interaction devices.

Done Research Projects
======
1. Infrared Video Human Action Recognition


2. Real-Time Ultrasound Gesture Recognition


3. Temporal Action Detection

Future Work
======

The use of Temporal Action Detection is 单一，I want to combine the use of TAD with indoor/outdoor localization. In this way we can get more useful information from a period of signal.
