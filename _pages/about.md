Hi, I am Zhendong. This homepage introduces myself and my previous research projects. 

Biography
======
I am a rising third-year master's student in Electronic Information at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, advised by Professor Le Zhang. My research focuses on wireless sensing and human-centric action recognition. I had developed a model for long-term recorded signal in MS.C. Additionally, I am actively exploring advancements in wireless based localization. My future goal is to create a multi-modality model for temporal action detection and localization using ambient sensors that can be deployed on human–computer interaction devices.

Done Research Projects
======
1. Infrared Video Human Action Recognition

3. Real-Time Ultrasound Gesture Recognition

When people are in TikTok, we dont want to touch the smartphone and want the smartphone to sense the human willings to across the air. During my internship at oppo inc. 

5. Temporal Action Detection based on WiFi CSI & IMU


Future Work
======

The use of Temporal Action Detection is 单一，I want to combine the use of TAD with indoor/outdoor localization. In this way we can get more useful information from a period of signal.
